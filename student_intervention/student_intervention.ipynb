In practice the algorithm works relevatively well on classification tasks with datasets that have a large amount of features without having to understand or model any of the complex relationships that might exist between features.

Since the model assumes the features are independent it can make the model easy to understand and efficient to training without the need for model tuning.\n",

When looking at the weight time for prediction time we get 0.0002, 0.0001, and 0.0021 seconds with DT perform the best and again SVC the worst. Taking the average performance values of the various training sizes for each model we get F1 test scores of 0.7145, 0.6739, 0.7956 with DT performing the worst and SVC the best.\n",

In addition there is no discussion of the cost benefit analysis or direct trade-offs of the computational resources vs the need to properly diagnoise student interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data seen so far I decided to use the Support Vector Classifier. The reason I decided to go with the SVC is that it provided the best average graduation score. Even though the computation time was much higher than the other models, I believe it produces more reliable results for the small dataset which is a small price to pay in exchange giving student early assistance. Without proper preventions it might cost the school more money in the long run than the computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If however the dataset was much larger where the cost of computer resources was paramount than I would argue it might favor the Naive Bayes model which still pretty reliable and scales well. The decision tree does not seem to produce a robust model to be of further consideration."

    "The Support Vector Classifier takes a look at similar students in the dataset and tries to find a boundary line that separates students that graduated from those who did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in the image below we can assign students that graduated as blue stars and those that did not as red dots. As we can see the blue star students are clustered near each other to the left and vice versa for the red dot students on the right. In order to distinguish both group we can draw a boundary line as showen in red that tries to maximize the gap between both groups. In order for the model to find the best boundary, it looks at the students that are farthest from their respective groups and nearest to the opposing group (as seen by the star and two dots with yellow fillings). Once the boundary points are identified, they are used to find and construct two parallel 'margin' lines (as shown in the two black dashed lines) that would maximize the gap between all the boundary points found earlier. The boundary line is drawn straight through these two parallel black lines and will determine how future students are assessed based on which side of the boundary they lie on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the boundry line is complex, the SVC can redraw the labels into a new high dimensional feature which would help separate the students. For example suppose that the star students were in a circle surrounded by all the red dot students. In this case a simple linear decision boundary would not accurately separate both groups. However if we redraw the chart into 3 dimensions we can give students in the center of the graph a high graduation score than the outer group. By assigining different graduation scores based on where the student lines in the new chart we can create a new boundary line (plane) based off how high or low the graduation score feature is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a decision boundary line separates the distinct qualities that determine graduation rates, we can than use it to determine if new students might likely graduate or need more interventions. For example if we have a new student that exhibits behaviors that would result in them being plotted on the lower right we would expect that they would need further intervention. \n",

Given the large number of features and the limited amount of data it would be recommended to perform additional data preprocessing and feature reduction. For example using feature importance or uni and bivariate analysis, principal component analysis just to name a few would help identify and extract useful information from the features to reduce issues with dimensionality and hopefully improve model performance."
